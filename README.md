## [Easy Digital Downloads - Product Taxes](https://sellcomet.com/downloads/product-taxes/)

Product Taxes for Easy Digital Downloads allows you to apply different tax rates to physical goods and services, while continuing to use the default tax rates for digital downloads. This allows you to easily sell merchandise (such as t-shirts, mugs and alike), physical products, or services alongside your digital products.

The new tax rates can be enabled on a per-download or category basis, or if you have Simple Shipping (or Downloads As Services) active, products marked as either “shippable” or “services” will automatically inherit the custom tax rates (this can be optionally disabled, if required).

Product tax rates can also be applied to fees, meaning the same custom tax rules will be applied to Shipping fees and alike.
